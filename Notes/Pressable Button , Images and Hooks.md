- **Dynamic Styling**: Customize styles based on interaction states, allowing for a responsive UI.

### Benefits

- **User Feedback**: Enhances interactivity by providing visual cues during touch interactions.
- **Accessibility**: Supports better accessibility practices by managing different touch states.
- **Flexibility**: Can be utilized as buttons, links, or any touch-sensitive component.
